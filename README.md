# case-study-bike-bike-share-navigate-speedy-success

This work is part of as the requirement for completion of the Google Data Analytics Certificate through Coursera. This is my final capstone project in the course. In this case study, I will be analyzing a public dataset for a fictional company called “Cyclistic” provided by the course. I will be using the R programming language for data analysis. To answer a business task; Cyclistic’s historical trip data is used to analyse and identify trends of the previous eleven (11) Months from January to December 2023.
Process

# Process

1.  I downloaded the data from January 2023 to Novmber 2023.<br />

2.  Load eleven (11) months dataset. <br />

3. Combining the eleven 11 months of year 2023 and save the combined file of Dataset to csv file. <br />

5. Remove all “NA” columns. <br />

6. Convert date (started_at and ended_at ) columns as date time and  split date into day, day of week, month, hours and minutes.
7. Calculate thr ride time duration in minutes. <br />
8. Remove rows contain a time duration is equal to or less than 0. <br />

9. Save the cleaning process  to csv file. <br />
# Analysis

You can look at the analysis I made in the R programming language in the Bikeproject.ipynb file.

# Share
In this step, will create visualizations and key findings through Google colab. <br />
# Act
### Conclusions:
Members usually ride at weekday while casual members ride more at weekends. <br />
The number of rides on Winter is decreseing during the year. <br />
The docked bikes is the lowest usge, so consider improvements. <br />
 The peak time is ideal for client interactions , then, early in the morning as it is the sporting time. <br />

### Recommendations:
Increase marketing efforts targeting casual riders to become members, also, in weekend and winter. <br />
During Summer, it provide a limited subscription or discuents on subscription. <br />
